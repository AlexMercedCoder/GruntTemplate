# Grunt Template

A template with grunt.

`npm run build` => babel transpiles and minifies src/index.js to dist/index.js.

`npm run dev` => runs build then runs a static server that updates with file changes (you still have to manually run the build for changes in src.)

watch and concat grunt plugins are installed but not tasks are yet configured.
